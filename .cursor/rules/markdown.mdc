# Markdown

- When writing a codeblock, have a new line above one.

  Bad example:

      ... then create a file with the following
      ```yaml
      foo: bar
      ```

  Good example:

      ... then create a file with the following

      ```yaml
      foo: bar
      ```

- Inline codeblocks don't need to have a new line above.

  Original:

      - Run the following: `pytest .`

  Bad example:

      - Run the following

        ```
        pytest .
        ```

  Good example:

      - Run the following: `pytest .`

      (Keep the original inline codeblock)

- When writing a shell command code block, use `sh` instead of `bash`.

  Bad example:

      ```bash
      echo hi
      ```

  Good example:

      ```sh
      echo hi
      ```
